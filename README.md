Welcome to my GitHub repository for the second-week tasks assigned by VaultofCodes! 🚀

## Overview
In this repository, you'll find the solutions and resources related to the tasks I completed during the second week of my journey with VaultofCodes. These tasks challenged my coding and problem-solving skills and allowed me to explore various aspects of software development.

## Tasks
1. **Task 1:** Created an in-depth presentation on "Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java" and "File Handling in Java." 📂📝 Exploring these crucial Java concepts was an enriching experience!

2. **Task 2:** Developed a program that calculates and displays the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive method. 🧮 This classic algorithm was a coding adventure!
